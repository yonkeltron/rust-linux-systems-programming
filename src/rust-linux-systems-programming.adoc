== Jonathan E. Magen / @yonkeltron

=== PLUG: Philly Linux User Group


== Who is this guy?

* Principal Computer Scientist
* 6 years at current company (healthcare)
* 5 years in startups before that
* Linux user since the early days


==  Why are we here?



==  To learn about Rust and Linux!


== Agendanomics

* Some definitions and history
* Intro to Rust
* Linux systems programming
* Examine a real application: Hermione
* Q&A with co-maintainers

==  What is Systems Programming?

== Systems Programming

Broadly: Non-app programming like

* OS development
** Kernels
** Drivers
* System software
** Daemons
** Infrastructure components
* Frameworks and libraries
** Game engines



==  This term is a bit silly.



== Why is this definition silly?

At face value you could do "Systems Programming" with:

* Elixir
* TypeScript on Node.js
* Python

NOTE: We normally think of systems programming languages as natively compiled ones.

==  Whatever.



== Traditionally, systems programming has been the domain of C and C++.



==  Mistakes were done.

=== Unchecked, manual memory management leads to bugs! 


== Enter the challengers

* D
* Google’s Go
* Zig
* Nim
* Rust

==  We’re obviously here for Rust, though.



== Some active Rust OS dev projects

* https://www.redox-os.org/[Redox] is a Unix-like microkernel OS
* https://www.tockos.org/[Tock] is an OS for IoT
* https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/[Firecracker] is an
AWS-sponsored project for VM, container, and function-based services



==  What about icon:linux[]?



==  Rust icon:heart[] Linux



==  Rust icon:heart[] Windows



==  Rust icon:heart[] macOS


== And I icon:heart[] all of you!

===  Ok, sure.

== No, seriously. Rust is fantastic!

* Originally developed at Mozilla
* Used by many, including AWS
* Designed with some very novel features

== Novel features of Rust

* Safety
* Ergonomics
* Efficiency

== Safety baked into types

Affine types

* From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_logic[affine logic], a
substructural logic
* Values may be used at most once

If this sounds weird, it’s because it is. Weirdly wonderful.



== Safety enforced by the compiler

Borrow checker

* Makes sure your code doesn’t use values it shouldn’t
* Higher learning curve

Added to D, being
https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/OwnershipManifesto.md[added
to Swift].



== Evern more of Rust’s safety mechanisms

* Compile-time memory management with lifetimes
** Compiler does the hard work for you
** Fine-grained control, without `malloc` and `free` details.
* No `null` or equivalent, `Option<T>` instead



== Ecosystem ergonomics

* Best compiler I’ve ever worked with
** Fantastic error messages
** A bit slow, though
* Great tooling
** Linting with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy[clippy]
** https://github.com/rust-lang/rls[RLS] and
https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer[Rust Analyzer] for editor
integration
** Formatting with https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt[`rustfmt`]



== Rust-the-language cares about users

Incredible linguistic attention to programmer productivity:

* Functional programming constructs come standard
* Pattern matching
* Expressions
* Macros
* Objects but no inheritance
** Traits!



== Less terrible error handling

=== Compiler-checked errors with `Result<T, E>` to mark fallible computation

* No exceptions
* Single return values
* Error propagation made simpler
** https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Try.html[`std::ops::Try`]
** The
https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html[`?`]
operator




== Efficiency

* Zero-cost abstractions
** You don’t pay for what you don’t use
* Optimizing compiler
** Slow because it does a LOT!
* Speed, relative to C: ~90%
** Common Lisp: ~80%
** Go: ~60-70%



== Concurrency and parallelism

* Threads (stdlib)
* Futures (`async` and `await`)
* Actors (https://riker.rs/[Riker], https://lib.rs/crates/spaad[spaad],
others…)


==  Sounds good.



==  Yes. It is pretty good.



==  So where does Linux come in?



== Lots of Linux software being written in Rust

* https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono[vopono] Manage per-app VPN tunnels
* https://github.com/orhun/kmon[kmon] Linux kernel monitor + activity
* https://github.com/Canop/lfs[lfs] Linux filesystem info tool


== Helpful Rust crates (libraries) for systems programming

Some of my favorites:

* https://crates.io/crates/libc[libc] - Foreign-Function Interface (FFI)
* https://crates.io/crates/nix[nix] - Friendlier *nix bindings
* https://crates.io/crates/procfs[procfs] - Interface to `/proc`
* https://crates.io/crates/caps[caps] - Linux capabilities


==  Let’s look at some code!



== We will first build a Linux process viewer!



==  First thing’s first:

==  Meet `cargo`!

==  (Cargo is Rust’s build tool.)


== Crates we will use

* https://crates.io/crates/color-eyre[color-eyre] for pretty error
handling
* https://crates.io/crates/procfs[procfs] - For interfacing with `/proc`
* https://crates.io/crates/paris[paris] - For stylish output



== Add our dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file

[source,toml]
----
[dependencies]
color-eyre = "0.5"
paris = "1.5"
procfs = "0.9"
----



== Add code to our project

[source,rust,line-numbers]
----
use color_eyre::eyre::Result;
use paris::Logger;

pub fn view_procs() -> Result<()> {
  let mut logger = Logger::new();

  logger.info("Starting up!").newline(1).log("Processes:");

  procfs::process::all_processes()?
    .into_iter()
    .map(|process| {
      format!(
        "{}: {} - {} bytes",
        process.pid, process.stat.comm, process.stat.vsize
      )
    })
    .for_each(|process_message| {
      logger.indent(1).info(process_message);
    });

  Ok(())
}
----



==  Let’s break this down!



== Preamble and first bits

[source,rust]
----
// Imports
use color_eyre::eyre::Result; // Error handling
use paris::Logger; // Stylish logging

// The primary function is fallible and so returns a Result
pub fn view_procs() -> Result<()> {
----



== Logging some output

[source,rust]
----
  // New up a logger, which is marked as mutable with mut
  let mut logger = Logger::new();
  // Emit some friendly output to the terminal
  logger.info("Starting up!").newline(1).log("Processes:");
----



== Remember:

=== The `?` operator either returns the contents of the `Result` or short circuits by bubbling up the error to the calling function!



== The guts of the process viewer

[source,rust]
----
 procfs::process::all_processes()? // Grab all processes
    .into_iter() // Get them in an iterator
    .map(|process| { // Map processes to Strings
      format!(
        "{}: {} - {} bytes", // Grab the PID, name, and memory usage
        process.pid, process.stat.comm, process.stat.vsize
      )
    }) // Log each string!
    .for_each(|process_message| {
      logger.indent(1).info(process_message);
    });
----



== Close it out, bring it home

[source,rust]
----
  // Signal that it all went well
  Ok(()) // Note: no semicolon means a return expression
}
----

== Walla! We’re done!



==  Less than 25 lines, with spaces!



==  It doesn’t have to _feel_ low-level to _be_ low-level.



==  Rust usually feels high-level.



==  Ok. Now what?



== Next, let’s explore the wide world of filesystem event notifications provided by https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html[inotify]!


==  `inotify(7)` is money, but confusing!



== The `nix` crate makes it much simpler, though!



== Let’s write a little inotify program which watches for filesystem changes.



[source,rust,line-numbers]
----
use color_eyre::eyre::Result;
use nix::sys::inotify;
use paris::Logger;

pub fn setup_watcher(path_str: &str) -> Result<bool> {
  let watcher = inotify::Inotify::init(inotify::InitFlags::empty())?;
  let watch = watcher.add_watch(path_str, inotify::AddWatchFlags::IN_ALL_EVENTS)?;

  let mut logger = Logger::new();
  let mut go = true;

  while go {
    logger.newline(1).loading("Waiting for events...");
    let events = watcher.read_events()?;
    logger.info(format!("Got {} events", events.len()));

    for event in events {
      let msg = format!("Event: {:?} for {:?}", event.mask, event.name);
      logger.indent(1).log(msg);
    }
  }

  watcher.rm_watch(watch)?;

  Ok(go)
}
----



==  Again, we’ll break this down!



[source,rust]
----
// Create our function which takes a path as a string slice
pub fn setup_watcher(path_str: &str) -> Result<bool> {
  // Initialize our watcher
  let watcher = inotify::Inotify::init(inotify::InitFlags::empty())?;
  // Create the watch!
  let watch = watcher.add_watch(path_str, inotify::AddWatchFlags::IN_ALL_EVENTS)?;
----



[source,rust]
----
  // New up a logger
  let mut logger = Logger::new();
  // Set a stop variable
  let mut go = true;

  // Loop until not go
  while go {
    logger.newline(1).loading("Waiting for events...");
    // Read events from the queue, otherwise block!
    let events = watcher.read_events()?;
    logger.info(format!("Got {} events", events.len()));
----



[source,rust]
----
    // Loop over events
    for event in events {
      // Make a nice message
      let msg = format!("Event: {:?} for {:?}", event.mask, event.name);
      // Print it out
      logger.indent(1).log(msg);
    }
  }

  // Clean up our watch just in case
  watcher.rm_watch(watch)?;

  // All done!
  Ok(go)
}
----



== Problems with this inotify example

[arabic]
. The `go` variable will always be `true`.
. It is an overly-broad watch (`IN_ALL_EVENTS`)!
. It doesn’t traverse the directory tree.

Try to ignore these. Work with me, here.



==  Ok. So.



==  Systems Programming!



==  It doesn’t have to be painful!
