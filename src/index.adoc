== Jonathan E. Magen / @yonkeltron

=== PLUG: Philly Linux User Group

== What is this?

A talk presented to the http://www.phillylinux.org/[Philly Linux User Group (PLUG)] on January 6th, 2021.
The topic is "Linux Systems Programming with Rust" and focuses on Linux-specific programming with the https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust Programming Language].
This talk will feature exactly zero slides and will be made entirely available, complete with working example code, online.

== Who is this Jonathan guy?

* Principal Computer Scientist
* 6 years at current company (healthcare)
* 5 years in startups before that
* Linux user since the early days
** Early days means
*** Prior to RedHat Linux 9!
*** Started when Linux Live CDs were *very* new


==  Why are we here?



==  To learn about Rust and Linux!


== Agendanomics

* Some definitions and history
* Intro to Rust
* Linux systems programming
* Examine a real application: Hermione
** Q&A with co-maintainers
* Future work

==  What is Systems Programming?

== Systems Programming

Broadly: Non-app programming like

* OS development
** Kernels
** Drivers
* System software
** Daemons
** Infrastructure components
* Frameworks and libraries
** Game engines



==  This term is a bit silly.



== Why is this definition silly?

At face value you could do "Systems Programming" with:

* https://elixir-lang.org/[Elixir/OTP]
* https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] on https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] or https://elixir-lang.org/[Deno]
* Python or Ruby

NOTE: We typically think of systems programming languages as natively compiled ones.

==  Whatever.



== Traditionally, systems programming has been the domain of C and C++.

* Especially in the Unix world
** https://www.gnome.org/[GNOME] desktop software written with https://gtk.org/[GTK] in C
** https://kde.org/[KDE] desktop environment written with https://www.qt.io/[Qt] in C++
* Certainly on Linux
** Linux kernel written (mostly) in C
** Both https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/[`glibc`] and https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/[GNU Coreutils] written in C


==  Mistakes were done.

=== Unchecked, manual memory management leads to bugs! 


== Enter the challengers

* https://golang.org/[Google's Go]
* https://crystal-lang.org/[Crystal]
* https://dlang.org/[D]
* https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/[Scala Native]
* https://nim-lang.org/[Nim]
* https://ziglang.org/[Zig]
* Rust

==  We’re obviously here for Rust, though.



== Some active Rust OS dev projects

* https://www.redox-os.org/[Redox] is a Unix-like microkernel OS
* https://www.tockos.org/[Tock] is an OS for IoT
* https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/[Firecracker] is an
AWS-sponsored project for VM, container, and function-based services



==  What about icon:linux[]?



==  Rust icon:heart[] Linux



==  Rust icon:heart[] Windows



==  Rust icon:heart[] macOS


== And I icon:heart[] all of you!

===  Ok, sure.

== No, seriously. Rust is fantastic!

* Originally developed at https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/[Mozilla]
* Used by many, including https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS]
* Designed with some very novel features

== Novel features of Rust

* Safety
* Ergonomics
* Efficiency

== Safety baked into types

Affine types

* From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_logic[affine logic], a
substructural logic
* Values may be used at most once

NOTE: If this sounds weird, it’s because it is. Weirdly wonderful.



== Safety enforced by the compiler

Borrow checker

* Makes sure your code doesn’t use values it shouldn’t
* Higher learning curve

Added to D, being
https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/OwnershipManifesto.md[added
to Swift].



== Evern more of Rust’s safety mechanisms

* Compile-time memory management with lifetimes
** Compiler does the hard work for you
** Fine-grained control, without `malloc` and `free` details.
* No `null` or equivalent, https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/index.html[`Option<T>`] instead



== Ecosystem ergonomics

* Best compiler I’ve ever worked with
** Fantastic error messages
** A bit slow, though
* Great tooling
** Linting with https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy[clippy]
** https://github.com/rust-lang/rls[RLS] and
https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer[Rust Analyzer] for editor
integration
** Formatting with https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt[`rustfmt`]



== Rust-the-language cares about users

Incredible linguistic attention to programmer productivity:

* Functional programming constructs come standard
* Pattern matching
* Expressions
* Macros
* Objects (structs) but no inheritance
** Traits!

NOTE: Traits are a bit different from Scala's implementation.
This remains mostly due to their deliberate simplicity and an equally deliberate omission of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_(type_theory)[Higher-Kinded Types (HKTs)].

== Less terrible error handling

=== Compiler-checked errors with `Result<T, E>` to mark fallible computation

* No exceptions!
* Single return values
* Error propagation made simpler
** https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Try.html[`std::ops::Try`]
** The
https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html[`?`]
operator




== Efficiency

* Zero-cost abstractions
** You don’t pay for what you don’t use
* Optimizing compiler
** Slow because it does a LOT!
* Speed, relative to C: ~90%
** https://common-lisp.net/[Common Lisp]: ~80%
** Go: ~60-70%



== Concurrency and parallelism

* Threads (included in the https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/index.html[`std::thread`] module)
* Futures (`async` and `await` with the https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html[`Future`] trait)
* Actors (https://riker.rs/[Riker], https://lib.rs/crates/spaad[spaad], https://github.com/sunli829/xactor[Xactor],
others…)


==  Sounds good.



==  Yes. It is pretty good.



==  So where does Linux come in?



== Lots of Linux software being written in Rust

* https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono[vopono] Manage per-app VPN tunnels
* https://github.com/orhun/kmon[kmon] Linux kernel monitor + activity
* https://github.com/Canop/lfs[lfs] Linux filesystem info tool


== Helpful Rust crates (libraries) for systems programming

Some of my favorites:

* https://crates.io/crates/libc[libc] - Foreign-Function Interface (FFI)
* https://crates.io/crates/nix[nix] - Friendlier *nix bindings
* https://crates.io/crates/procfs[procfs] - Interface to `/proc`
* https://crates.io/crates/caps[caps] - Linux capabilities

== This talk will become more about Linux-specific programming

==  Let’s look at some code!

.Goals
* Maintain realism by using actual libraries.
* Show how to use Linux-specific functionality where possible.
* Explain examples with context.


== We will first build a Linux process viewer!



==  First thing’s first:

===  Meet https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/[`cargo`]!

====  (Cargo is Rust’s build tool.)


== Crates we will use

* https://crates.io/crates/color-eyre[color-eyre] for pretty error
handling
* https://crates.io/crates/procfs[procfs] - For interfacing with `/proc`
* https://crates.io/crates/paris[paris] - For stylish output



== Add our dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file

[source,toml]
----
[dependencies]
color-eyre = "0.5"
paris = "1.5"
procfs = "0.9"
----



== Add code to our project

[source,rust,linenums]
----
// <1>
use color_eyre::eyre::Result;
use paris::Logger;

// <2>
pub fn view_procs() -> Result<()> {
  let mut logger = Logger::new();

  logger.info("Starting up!").newline(1).log("Processes:");

  // <3>
  procfs::process::all_processes()?
    .into_iter()
    .map(|process| {
      format!(
        "{}: {} - {} bytes",
        process.pid, process.stat.comm, process.stat.vsize
      )
    })
    .for_each(|process_message| {
      logger.indent(1).info(process_message);
    });

  Ok(())
}
----
<1> Preamble
<2> Function definition
<3> Main meat of the program


==  Let’s break this down!



== Preamble and first bits

[source,rust]
----
// <1>
use color_eyre::eyre::Result; // <2>
use paris::Logger; // <3>

// <4>
pub fn view_procs() -> Result<()> {
----
<1> Imports
<2> Colored error handling
<3> Stylish logging output on the console
<4> The primary function is fallible and so returns a `Result`

== Logging some output

[source,rust]
----
  // <1>
  let mut logger = Logger::new();
  // <2>
  logger.info("Starting up!").newline(1).log("Processes:");
----
<1> New up a logger, which is marked as mutable with `mut`
<2> Emit some friendly output to the terminal


== Remember:

=== The `?` operator either returns the contents of the `Result` or short circuits by bubbling up the error to the calling function!



== The guts of the process viewer

[source,rust]
----
 procfs::process::all_processes()? // <1>
    .into_iter() // <2>
    .map(|process| { // <3>
      format!(
        "{}: {} - {} bytes", // <4>
        process.pid, process.stat.comm, process.stat.vsize
      )
    }) // <5>
    .for_each(|process_message| {
      logger.indent(1).info(process_message);
    });
----
<1> Query all processes from `/proc`
<2> Get them in an iterator
<3> Map processes to `String`s
<4> Grab the PID, name, and memory usage
<5> Log each string!


== Close it out, bring it home

[source,rust]
----
  // <1>
  Ok(()) // <2>
}
----
<1> Signal that it all went well by returning an empty `Ok`
<2> Note: no semicolon means a return expression


== Walla! We’re done!



==  Less than 25 lines, with spaces!



==  It doesn’t have to _feel_ low-level to _be_ low-level.



==  Rust usually feels high-level.



==  Ok. Now what?



== Next, let’s explore the wide world of filesystem event notifications provided by https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html[inotify]!


==  `inotify(7)` is money, but confusing!



== The `nix` crate makes it much simpler, though!



== Let’s write a little inotify program which watches for filesystem changes.



[source,rust,linenums]
----
// <1>
use color_eyre::eyre::Result;
use nix::sys::inotify;
use paris::Logger;

// <2>
pub fn setup_watcher(path_str: &str) -> Result<bool> {
  // <3>
  let watcher = inotify::Inotify::init(inotify::InitFlags::empty())?;
  let watch = watcher.add_watch(path_str, inotify::AddWatchFlags::IN_ALL_EVENTS)?;

  let mut logger = Logger::new();
  let mut go = true;

  // <4>
  while go {
    logger.newline(1).loading("Waiting for events...");
    let events = watcher.read_events()?;
    logger.info(format!("Got {} events", events.len()));

    for event in events {
      let msg = format!("Event: {:?} for {:?}", event.mask, event.name);
      logger.indent(1).log(msg);
    }
  }
  // <5>
  watcher.rm_watch(watch)?;

  Ok(go)
}
----
<1> Preamble
<2> Function definition
<3> Setup
<4> Main logic
<5> Clean up

==  Again, we’ll break this down!



[source,rust]
----
// <1>
pub fn setup_watcher(path_str: &str) -> Result<bool> {
  // <2>
  let watcher = inotify::Inotify::init(inotify::InitFlags::empty())?;
  // <3>
  let watch = watcher.add_watch(path_str, inotify::AddWatchFlags::IN_ALL_EVENTS)?;
----
<1> Create our function which takes a path as a string slice
<2> Initialize our watcher
<3> Create the watch!

== Setup for main loop

[source,rust]
----
  // <1>
  let mut logger = Logger::new();
  let mut go = true;

  // <2>
  while go {
    logger.newline(1).loading("Waiting for events...");
    // <3>
    let events = watcher.read_events()?;
    logger.info(format!("Got {} events", events.len()));
----
<1> New up a logger and a stop variable
<2> Loop until not go
<3> Read events from the queue, otherwise block!

== Handling detected events

[source,rust]
----
    // <1>
    for event in events {
      // <2>
      let msg = format!("Event: {:?} for {:?}", event.mask, event.name);
      // <3>
      logger.indent(1).log(msg);
    }
  }

  // <4>
  watcher.rm_watch(watch)?;

  // <5>
  Ok(go)
}
----
<1> Loop over events
<2> Make a nice message
<3> Print it out
<4> Clean up our watch just in case
<5> All done!


== Problems with this inotify example

. The `go` variable will always be `true`.
. It is an overly-broad watch (`IN_ALL_EVENTS`)!
. It doesn’t traverse the directory tree.

NOTE: Try to ignore these. Work with me, here.



==  Ok. So.



==  Systems Programming!



==  It doesn’t have to be painful!
